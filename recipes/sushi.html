<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Today, we're making a variation on the <strong>California roll.</strong>
    Along with sushi rice and sheets of seaweed (nori), California rolls require only a few ingredients: crab meat (or imitation), avocado, and cucumber.
    If you like, mix the crab meat with a little mayo to create a creamy consistency.</p>

<p>To this basic list of ingredients, we've added sliced carrots and cooked shrimp...because that's how we (sushi) roll.
    Before we got further, a quick note on sushi rice.
    You can't use just any rice for sushi. Sushi rice is a special preparation of rice flavored with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt.
    It's made from short-grain rice (Japonica), typically made in Japan and parts of California and Italy.
    With homemade sushi rice, you're aiming for rice that's fluffy and a little sticky but not too sticky.
    Give it a try -- you'll get the hang of it. See how to make sushi rice.</p>
